# The-Office-Bot

The-Office-Bot was created to act as an example of how easy it is to create a bot using the open source [Simple-Slack-Bot library](https://greghilston.github.io/Simple-Slack-Bot/).

The-Office-Bot will look at every message sent to the channels that it is in, waiting for a mention of the name of a character in the show The Office, specifically the US version. Once received, The-Office-Bot will write back a random line that this character had throughout the show, including lines from deleted scenes.
